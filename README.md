coding assessment for health partners new role

Below are my additional comments.

# Key Highlights:
- **Solution Overview:** The code addresses the core requirements of the problem and ensures it functions as expected.
- **Structure and Scalability:** It is modular and structured for future enhancements.
- **Coding Standards:** Wherever feasible, I have adhered to industry-standard conventions for clarity and maintainability.
- **Documentation:** I have included step-by-step comments throughout the code to enhance its readability and clarity.  

# Areas for Improvement:
**With additional time, I would prioritize:**

- **Logging and monitoring:** Incorporating comprehensive logging for key steps in the workflow, making debugging and performance analysis more efficient.
- **Error Handling:**  Introduce more robust exception handling, covering edge cases, retries for possible errors, and graceful failures to ensure system reliability.    
- **Daily Orchestration and Scheduling:**  Use Databricks Workflows or tools like Apache Airflow for daily job scheduling and dependency management. I used the - --Databricks community edition to solve this assessment which doesn't support Databricks workflow feature.   
- **Additional Features:** Exploring further enhancements and testing to make the solution even more robust.
- **Alternate solution with Databricks/Pyspark:**  Implement an end-to-end workflow in PySpark that utilizes Spark DataFrames for better distributed processing and scalability.
